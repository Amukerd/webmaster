        <h2>Green energy, What is it?</h2>
        <p>Green energy, also known as renewable energy, refers to energy derived from resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale and have minimal environmental impact. The primary characteristic of green energy is its sustainable nature, as it doesn't deplete finite resources and typically has lower emissions compared to traditional fossil fuels.<br>

Here are some common forms of green energy:<br>

<li>Solar Energy: Harnessing the power of the sun using photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity.<br></li>

<li>Wind Energy: Utilizing the kinetic energy of the wind to generate electricity through wind turbines.<br></li>

<li>Biogas (Landfill Gas): Extracting gas produced by the decay of organic matter in landfills and converting it into energy.<br></li>

<li>Geothermal Energy: Tapping into the Earth's internal heat by harnessing steam or hot water from underground to generate electricity or provide direct heating.<br></li>

<li>Biomass: Using organic materials, such as wood, agricultural residues, or waste, to produce heat or electricity through combustion or other processes.<br></li>

<li>Low-Impact Hydroelectricity: Generating electricity through the movement of water, often in a river or dam, with minimal environmental impact compared to conventional hydroelectric power.<br></li>

<li>Emerging Technologies: Exploring and developing new technologies that have the potential to contribute to the green energy mix, such as advanced solar technologies, tidal energy, or innovative storage solutions.<br></li>

The key advantage of green energy is its reduced environmental footprint, as it produces fewer greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants compared to conventional fossil fuels. Investing in and transitioning to green energy sources is a crucial step in addressing climate change and creating a more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy system.</p>

        <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
        <p>
            Pros:<br>
            <li>Easy to use<br></li>
            <li>Easiest to install<br></li>
            <li>Easy to sustain<br></li>
            <li>Low operating costs<br></li>
            <li>Reduces your electric bill<br></li>
            <br>
            Cons:<br>
            <li>Initial installation cost can be substantial<br></li>
            <li>Less effective on cloudy days<br></li>
            <li>Requires some maintenance<br></li>
            <br>
            Despite the cons, the pros far outweigh them. Investing in solar panels can pay off, and any excess energy can be sold back to your electricity provider.<br>
