Green Energy

Green energy is clean energy that does not rely on harmful fossil fuels like coal and oil, which can harm our environment. It comes in various forms, including solar, wind, biogas (landfill gas), geothermal, biomass, low-impact hydroelectricity, and emerging technologies.

Solar Energy

Solar energy is one of the most popular and easiest forms of green energy. Here are its pros and cons:

Pros:

Easy to use
Easiest to install
Easy to sustain
Low operating costs
Reduces your electric bill
Cons:

Initial installation cost can be substantial
Less effective on cloudy days
Requires some maintenance
Despite the cons, the pros far outweigh them. Investing in solar panels can pay off, and any excess energy can be sold back to your electricity provider.

Tax Incentives

Solar panels can also benefit you in terms of taxes. The Federal Tax Credit can reduce your taxes, and some states offer additional tax rebates. States like California, New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Arizona, Oregon, and Colorado provide tax rebates when you install solar panels. These rebates reduce your overall tax burden.

Green Energy Practices

Practicing green energy is crucial to reducing our environmental impact. Some practical ways to do this include:

Opt for biking or using non-gas vehicles for shorter trips.
Use electric vehicles instead of gasoline-powered ones.
Carpool or take public transportation.
Contribute to environmental preservation by picking up trash.
Reduce your reliance on fossil fuels.
Encourage others to adopt green energy practices.
Biking and using electric vehicles reduce carbon emissions and offer eco-friendly transportation alternatives. Carpooling and taking public transportation reduce the number of cars on the road, further lowering emissions. Picking up trash helps keep our environment clean and safe. Reducing fossil fuel usage is essential for our planet's well-being and can be achieved through various means, such as electric vehicles, electric heating, and renewable resources. Lastly, influencing others to follow these practices is crucial for collective environmental progress.

Cost

Solar panels typically cost between $15,000 and $20,000, with some installations exceeding $25,000. The cost can be offset by selling excess energy back to the grid using "Net Billing." On average, homeowners pay around $31 per year for every kilowatt-hour they use, and there is usually a 25-year warranty for solar panels. Battery storage is common among homeowners due to the cost of commercial energy storage methods.

Geothermal Section---
How Does It Work?
When used for heating and cooling, the system employs pipes carrying water and anti-freeze. These pipes form a closed loop and circulate, constituting "ground source heat pump systems." They function by cooling buildings in summer and warming them in winter, drawing in the Earth's heat as water and steam circulate back into the building. An interesting tidbit: it can be used underground to melt snow and ice.

Now that You Understand How It Works, Let's Discuss Why You Should Make the Switch!
There's a multitude of advantages to adopting Geothermal Energy! It's clean, renewable, and emits just one-sixth of the carbon dioxide compared to a clean natural gas power plant. Additionally, it's highly sustainable and, unlike solar energy, provides a consistent energy flow. Moreover, it's exceptionally reliable for heating and cooling your home. As it doesn't require fuel to operate, you needn't fret over skyrocketing gas prices. The extensive research in this field indicates rapid evolution, further enhancing its appeal. While clean energy sources do have downsides, the benefits significantly outweigh the drawbacks.

Disadvantages

One drawback of this clean, renewable energy source is Location Restriction. Certain areas may be unsuitable due to accessibility requirements—it won't function well in places with extensive rock or hard surfaces. However, solar energy remains an option for such regions. Another aspect to consider is the potential release of natural gases during installation, stemming from trapped gases beneath the Earth's surface. Nevertheless, this release is minimal compared to fossil fuels. The primary downside, however, is its cost—installing geothermal energy systems tends to be pricier than solar setups.
